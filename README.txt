Telestic will be a top down roguelike broswer game

when starting the player will select and username and class,

player will then have a choice of different bosses to fight

player will pick the boss they wish to fight

we will make a couple of different bosses with different mechanics and gameplay

player will move using WASD and shoot by clicking
where ever the mouse is when the mouse is clicked is the direciton the player will shoot
depending on which class the player picked they will have different projectiles

mage will have a magic ball that does a large amount of damage at a slow rate

range will have a arrow that will do less damage at a faster rate

melee will be a close up projectile (we can make it look like a sword swinging) that will do alot of damage

LAVA DRAGON: (the boss we are working on right now)

PHASE1
lava dragon will rise from lava start at full hp
the lava dragon will start to attack and phase 1 will begin

PHASE2
at half health the lava dragon will enter phase 2
doing twice the damage 

PHASE3
at one fourth health the lave dragon will enter the final phase 3
dragon will change appearance
doing x3 of orginal damage


Each phase will have its own set of special attacks we will have to think of and code
(wave of fire going across the screen, random fire balls, etc....)

once health is at 0 lava dragon will play death animation
once lava dragon is dead player will recieve a random piece of equipment that can give differnt buffs

OTHER:
lava dragon will always face player unless attacking
if a player gets struck by fire we will apply a onfire buff to the player that will subtract health over x seconds

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



TO DO:
finish shooting and projectile system
start UI
start inventory system
start equipment system




future:
if this is a project we all enjoying making maybe we can consider these in the future
everything below is not something we will add, their just ideas

randomized dungeons
special attacks unique to the players picked class
dialogue system 
some sort of highscores system
profile system
looking into websockset coding and make a very basic multiplayer version?
